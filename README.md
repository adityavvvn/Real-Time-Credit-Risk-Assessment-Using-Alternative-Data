# Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data

This project demonstrates how machine learning and alternative data sources can be used to assess credit risk in real-time. It provides a modern approach to financial decision-making by leveraging customer behavior, payment patterns, and transaction history beyond traditional credit scores.

## 🧠 Project Overview

* **Goal**: Improve credit risk evaluation using real-time and alternative data sources.
* **Techniques**: Supervised machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation.
* **Impact**: Enhances financial inclusion and provides more accurate, timely credit assessments.

## 📁 Contents

* `Real-Time Credit Risk Assessment Using Alternative Data.ipynb`: Core implementation in a Jupyter notebook.
* `credit_risk_dataset.csv`, `customer_data.csv`, `payment_data.csv`, `dataset.xlsx`: Datasets used for model training and testing.
* `FTMM2024-1156-1160.pdf`: Research paper explaining the methodology and findings.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
